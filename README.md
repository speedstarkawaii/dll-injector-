# dll-injector 💯

NOT dll injector but external that partially works and is usermode.


⚠️ I DID NOT MAKE THE ACTUAL INJECTOR, I MODIFIED IT **THIS WAS LEAKED IN PLUSGIANT'S SERVER** AND 
THIS WAS ORIGINALLY USED FOR NYX-INTERNAL. 

i used this while studying how internal works a bit.

"now" (user) got hacked by nbeater and decided to leak it to everyone, ones willing to even pay for this so why not make it open source?
